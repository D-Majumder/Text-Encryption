## Example Usage

The code includes example usage for AES, DES, and RSA encryption and decryption:

### 1. **Generate RSA keys**  
   The RSA key generation function allows you to create public and private keys for asymmetric encryption.

### 2. **Encrypt AES and DES keys using RSA public key**  
   RSA public keys can be used to securely encrypt AES and DES keys for transmission.

### 3. **Decrypt AES and DES keys using RSA private key**  
   Use the RSA private key to decrypt AES and DES keys.

### 4. **Encrypt and decrypt a message using AES and DES**  
   Demonstrates how to use AES and DES for encrypting and decrypting messages with appropriate key padding.
